# Stats For Installed Mods

A method for creating stats such as "x% of lists have USSEP in them". Either do the stat on a case-by-case basis, where someone just goes "it'd be neat to see how many lists have $mod installed", then I do that. Alternatively, a method to anaylze the mod list files uploaded to the site and indicate how often they show up, etc. Challenges with both method include the fact that people name mods they install differently, `Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch` vs `USSEP` for example, and doing it by plugin names only, ignores mods with no plugins and the fact that plugin names don't always stay the same (some include version numbers, etc).
